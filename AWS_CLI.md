# AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) Documentation

## Overview
The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified tool that allows you to manage various AWS services from the command line. It provides a convenient way to interact with AWS resources and automate tasks through scripts.

## Installation
To install the AWS CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure that you have Python installed on your system, as AWS CLI requires Python to run.
2. **Installation**: Install the AWS CLI using pip, which is the package installer for Python. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
```bash
pip install awscli
```
This command will download and install the AWS CLI package.

3. **Configuration**: After installing the AWS CLI, you need to configure it with your AWS credentials. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
aws configure
```
This command will prompt you to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, AWS Region, and default output format.

## Usage
Once the AWS CLI is installed and configured, you can use it to interact with AWS services. Here are some common commands and their usage:

- **aws [service] [command] [options]**: Executes a specific command for the specified AWS service.

- **aws help**: Provides general help and displays a list of available commands.

- **aws [service] help**: Displays help for the specified AWS service.

- **aws [command] help**: Displays help for the specified command.

- **aws configure**: Allows you to reconfigure the AWS CLI with new credentials or update existing configuration.

### S3 Commands

- `aws s3 ls`: Lists all S3 buckets in your account.

- `aws s3 mb s3://bucket-name --region region-name`: Creates a new S3 bucket with the specified bucket name and region.

- `aws s3 cp local-file s3://bucket-name`: Copies a file from your local system to the specified S3 bucket.

- `aws s3 sync s3://source-bucket s3://destination-bucket`: Synchronizes the contents of the source S3 bucket with the destination S3 bucket.
